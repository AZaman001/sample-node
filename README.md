# sample-node
Used a sample Node app to demonstrate how to incorporate it in a CI/CD process with Docker, Wercker, OCIR and OKE

Note: I no longer have access to OKE instance I deployed to, but the files should definitely clarify the process by which you can successfully automatically dockerize and deploy a node app using Wercker and deploy it to OKE (Oracle Kubernets Engine).
